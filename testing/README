to build the tests and run then on linux or macos type:
	make
on solaris type:
	gmake -f Makefile.solaris

Note that the consumer and the producer tests will each issue one error
message.  This is because we test these functions with incorrect data to be
sure we detect the errors.
The side-effect is that an error message is displayed. But as long as you see
"All producer tests succeded" and "All consumer tests succeded", everything is
going fine.
